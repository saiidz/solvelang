# SolveLang Active Buildout Handoff

**Purpose:** durable repository/build truth for continuing `saiidz/solvelang` without duplicating merged work or confusing repository state with production state.

**Captured:** 2026-08-21

Before every build/integration run, reconcile current `main`, all open PRs, recent closed/merged/superseded PRs, exact branch heads/bases, mergeability, review threads, Hosted CI/Rust/RustSec, self-hosted validation when applicable, active branches, open issues, `.github/workflows`, `ROADMAP.md`, this handoff, and `docs/current-production-status-2026-08-20.md`. Live GitHub state and newer verified production evidence always win over hashes recorded here.

## Current repository checkpoint

At this refresh, reviewed source `main` is `33f53bbdd4e49ebfad759f529c9a54a54cc52277`, the safe merge of #673.

The safe non-production open-PR queue is **zero** at this checkpoint. The historical Repository Audit Python-import/dependency train #288 → #290 → #291 → #298 → #299 → #300 → #301 is merged and must not be recreated. Historical #161/#164/#169 are merged repository-state facts only; their former approval phrases are not standing authorization for live production actions.

## Most recent safe integration state

- #669 adds bounded structural coverage for candidate web roots whose owner or mode evidence is missing, with fair interleaving across evidence dimensions under the 100-reference cap.
- #670 composes #669 into canonical Server Audit JSON/HTML reports with an explicit authority limitation and redaction coverage.
- #671 synchronizes this handoff through #670; exact reviewed head `b6ed6b8b2381e4f29b7fa362570dd9de00c2541d` merged as `57367a407d70f462e4e9ab8144a3b1d75c9112ef`.
- #672 adds bounded structural filesystem-utilization findings using `filesystems[index].usagePercent` evidence instead of raw mount paths. It preserves the existing 80/90/95 percent thresholds, caps findings at 100, and keeps private mount identities out of finding payloads. Exact reviewed head `499516a044fc427f4fa3947933f8befb81ffe24f` merged as `6811d820812f8c40ba3566f8608982bd283fd447`.
- #673 composes #672 into canonical Server Audit JSON/HTML reports and filters the three legacy raw-mount filesystem-usage findings from report composition. It preserves severity semantics, adds an authority limitation, and pins redaction of private mount/device identities while retaining structural usage evidence. Exact reviewed head `4cb8fe663be993503ad9a526fb2a819091c533e1` merged as current `main` `33f53bbdd4e49ebfad759f529c9a54a54cc52277`.

Ordinary branches in this recent Server Audit train used exact-head GitHub-hosted CI and Rust/RustSec. Trusted Mac or Trusted Windows was not required for #669–#673 and neither self-hosted lane was substituted for Hosted validation.

## Major merged work that must not be recreated

### Repository Audit / Solve Graph

- #288 → #301 — deterministic Python imports plus dependency consistency, direct test/documentation mapping, conservative dead-code candidates, configuration/workflow relationships, and bounded report integration.
- #311/#313/#314 — affected-test/workflow intelligence and report composition.
- #317/#319/#322/#327/#332 — architecture/security-boundary analysis, integrity-covered artifacts, bounded presentation, and browser export.
- #329/#335 — deterministic ranked Solve Graph node search and MCP exposure.
- #333 — bounded local TypeScript `extends` and project-reference relationships.
- #337/#348/#349 — bounded visual-explorer model, presentation model, and browser panel.
- #341 — conservative repository-local PHP literal `require`/`include` relationships.
- #350→#371 — deployment-path, Angular/Nest framework-path, and Angular target-config evidence/artifact/presentation/browser integration.
- #372/#373 and #432→#448 — bounded shortest paths, product/browser verification, deterministic explanations, and additive read-only MCP exposure.
- #450→#456 — deterministic alternative-path and dependent-impact explanations across core/browser/MCP.
- #457→#472 — selected-node impact/affected-validation browser intelligence, cancellation-safe request state, stale-selection protection, workflow-evidence identity, and deterministic interaction coverage.
- #480 — bounded GitHub reusable-workflow reference evidence.
- #513/#519/#530/#534/#542 — bounded entrypoint/unreached-candidate graph intelligence and local explorer filtering; these are structural candidates, not runtime reachability claims.
- #535/#539 — bounded Node workspace metadata/snapshot evidence.
- #549/#552/#556/#557 — bounded static Cargo, Go, .NET, and Maven evidence adapters. They parse explicit local files only and never evaluate build tools or resolve registries.
- #562→#578 — bounded static Docker Compose service/image and `depends_on` evidence, snapshot/artifact/presentation/browser surfaces, quoted static service keys, dependency panel, and top-level product wiring. Compose evaluation, interpolation/anchors/profiles, image resolution, container starts, network access, and writes remain disabled.

### Server Audit

Server Audit remains read-only and non-remediating. Merged capabilities include a fixed allowlisted collector surface; bounded snapshot/schema parsing; OS/system/filesystem/socket/service/package/scheduled-job/process/web/backup/log/security/certificate evidence; deterministic findings; redaction; JSON/HTML reporting; process/listener/package/certificate/permission/inventory consistency checks; bounded service→process, service→process→listener, scheduled-job→service/process, recognized web-server→service/package, and filesystem→artifact structural relationships; ambiguity/unresolved/truncation/partial-fanout findings; stale/large-log evidence; local web/TLS/listener consistency; backup/log contradiction findings; certificate-expiry fallback and coverage; fail-closed public-file reference/coverage integrity; backup posture plus freshness/size coverage; log inventory/metadata coverage; explicit empty-inventory coverage; identity coverage; missing filesystem-utilization coverage; incomplete system telemetry/load-vector coverage; incomplete web-root owner/mode coverage; and canonical JSON/HTML composition for those states.

Key trains that must not be recreated:

- #575/#576/#579 — backup/log consistency evidence, findings, and canonical report composition with exact-overlap deduplication.
- #581→#615 — certificate/public-file/backup/log/service/package/listener/process/scheduled-job/filesystem/web coverage, security-probe truth, normal systemd state truth, and canonical report regression coverage.
- #617→#628 — bounded/redacted service→process→listener, service→process, and scheduled-job→service/process relationship findings/report composition plus relationship construction/index/fanout hardening.
- #630→#637 — certificate/web/service/process/package identity coverage and canonical report composition.
- #641/#643 — listener identity coverage and report composition.
- #648/#650 — filesystem identity coverage and report composition.
- #652/#653 — scheduled-job source/command identity coverage and canonical report composition.
- #655/#656 — local TLS-certificate/port-443 listener consistency and canonical report composition.
- #658 — duplicate-listener ownership consistency canonical report composition.
- #659 — recognized web-server/service/package relationship canonical report composition.
- #661/#662 — filesystem `usagePercent` coverage and canonical report composition.
- #666/#668 — incomplete supplied system telemetry/load-vector coverage and canonical report composition.
- #669/#670 — bounded web-root ownership/permission evidence coverage and canonical report composition.
- #672/#673 — structural filesystem-utilization findings and canonical report composition replacing legacy raw-mount evidence.

Automatic remote remediation execution remains out of scope.

### Language/runtime and DX

- #482/#485/#488/#492 — loop control, conservative semantic checking, formatter/linter work.
- #517/#520/#523/#525/#527/#543 — deterministic pure collection/object helpers while hardened execution continues to deny capability-bearing builtins.
- #503/#510/#512/#518/#521/#526/#529 — local stdio-only LSP diagnostics/symbols/definition/hover/highlights/completion/semantic tokens/formatting.
- #515/#516 — opt-in VS Code package with executable launch disabled by default.
- #577 — root-confined writes reject an existing symbolic-link final component.
- #537 — browser/WASM parity ADR; pure-core extraction is still required before browser runtime work.

## Current safe engineering order

Re-evaluate live state before every run. When the safe non-production PR queue exceeds six, drain it before unrelated feature work.

With the queue at zero, the strongest safe continuations are:

1. keep `ROADMAP.md`, this handoff, Issue #157, and production truth synchronized;
2. continue bounded Repository Audit / Solve Graph reference, path, impact, affected-validation, MCP/Codex, and visual-explorer quality without executing repository source;
3. continue Server Audit read-only relationship/posture hardening: package/service/port/process/scheduled-job relationships, cache/log/backup consistency, domain/TLS/public-file evidence, ownership/permission/version truth, deterministic redaction, and cross-platform report tests;
4. continue language/runtime and DX through conservative semantics, diagnostics, package/module design, pure-core extraction, and non-executing editor support;
5. continue dormant customer-priority engineering only while queue/customer/provider gates remain OFF: source integrity, leases/retries/DLQ/observability, account/entitlement enforcement, report retention, credential boundaries, preflight validation, and safe browser/API readiness;
6. continue TOTP account-enrollment/login/backup-code preparation without repeating already-live infrastructure rollout or mutating accounts absent explicit approval;
7. continue billing readiness while production billing stays OFF and no real Stripe activity is authorized.

## Customer-priority production truth

A separately triggered production workflow run `32431853270` successfully deployed the durable customer-priority foundation in **dormant** mode.

That deployment does **not** authorize or establish live customer-priority execution. The preserved boundary is:

- durable queue/foundation resources: deployed;
- queue processing gate: OFF;
- customer-priority gate: OFF;
- provider-execution gate: OFF;
- production billing: OFF;
- customer source upload / job submission through the new provider path: not established;
- credit consumption through the new provider path: not established.

Repository provider/credential/report-retention/lease-hardening merges remain preparation only. They do not create or read live provider credentials, wire a provider into the production worker handler, call a provider, activate processing, expose customer priority, or enable billing.

## Self-hosted validation policy

### Trusted Mac

`.github/workflows/trusted-mac-ci.yml` is push-only for owner-controlled `agent/mac-*`, read-only, targets `[self-hosted, macOS, ARM64]`, and uses `cancel-in-progress: false`. Missing, queued, or unobserved status is not success. Never modify runner registration/services or substitute Windows for a required Mac result.

### Trusted Windows

`.github/workflows/trusted-windows-ci.yml` is push-only for owner-controlled `agent/windows-*`, read-only, uses no repository secrets, targets `[self-hosted, Windows, X64]`, and uses `cancel-in-progress: false`. Use it when materially useful for Windows/cross-platform behavior. Never interrupt a busy runner or treat Windows as a substitute for an explicit Trusted Mac requirement.

## Authoritative production truth

`docs/current-production-status-2026-08-20.md` is authoritative for the TOTP/KMS/IAM facts explicitly re-verified on 2026-08-20. Later verified production facts must be layered on explicitly rather than inferred from repository merges.

Current production boundaries include:

- API access and customer accounts/password authentication: enabled;
- private Admin Gateway/static Admin UI behind Cloudflare Access: live from separately approved production work;
- authenticator-app TOTP environment feature flag: enabled;
- dedicated production TOTP KMS stack/key/alias: live and re-verified;
- expected TOTP preflight/deploy OIDC supplemental policies: attached and re-verified;
- specific customer-account authenticator enrollment: separate account-level state; not established by infrastructure state;
- durable customer-priority foundation: deployed dormant;
- queue processing: OFF;
- customer priority: OFF;
- provider execution: OFF;
- subscription billing and production billing webhook: disabled;
- paid priority: disabled;
- real-charge authorization: none;
- general managed hosted SolveLang workflow execution: not live;
- Repository Audit write/remediation mode: disabled;
- Server Audit mutation/remediation mode: disabled.

Repository merges do not change those live-state facts by themselves.

## Hard production boundary

Do not automatically live-apply AWS/IAM/KMS changes, deploy production, change DNS/private ingress/Cloudflare Access, publish or mutate the production Admin UI, enroll customer TOTP, activate queue/customer/provider processing, enable customer priority, enable billing, use live Stripe/provider credentials, create charges/refunds, send email, mutate production customer/CRM data, execute uploaded customer source in production, or bypass protected environments/owner approvals.

If a production-sensitive track reaches an approval gate, stop that track and continue safe repository-only work elsewhere.
